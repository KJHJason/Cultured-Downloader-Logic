Simple script to bypass Cloudflare protection using [DrissionPage](https://github.com/g1879/DrissionPage).

Notes:
- Logic originally based on [sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping](https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping)
- This script will NOT work if your IP address already has a bad reputation!
